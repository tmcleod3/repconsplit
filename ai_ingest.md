# INSTRUCTIONS FOR INGESTING SPLIT REPOSITORY FILES

This repository contains multiple Markdown files, each representing a chunk of a consolidated Git repository. The files are split into manageable parts, enabling seamless ingestion by large language models (LLMs) like yourself, even if constrained by token or file size limits. Your task is to process these files sequentially, reconstruct the repository’s structure, and analyze its contents.

---

## FILE OVERVIEW

### File Names and Organization:
- Files are sequentially named:
  - `consolidated_repository_part_1.md`
  - `consolidated_repository_part_2.md`
  - ...
  - `consolidated_repository_part_<n>.md`

- Each file represents up to **500 lines** of content, maintaining logical continuity between parts.

### Purpose:
- These files consolidate all source code, configuration files, and documentation from the original Git repository into an accessible Markdown format.
- By processing these files, you can analyze and reconstruct the repository without needing access to its original structure or external dependencies.

### Format:
- File paths are introduced as **Markdown section headers** for clear navigation.
- File contents are encapsulated in **code blocks** (` ```plaintext `) to preserve formatting and ensure readability.

---

## CONTENT STRUCTURE

### Each Split File Contains:
1. **Main Title**:
   - At the top of every file: `# Consolidated Repository`.

2. **File Sections**:
   - Each repository file is presented with its relative path as a section header:
     ```markdown
     ## relative/path/to/file
     ```

3. **Code Blocks**:
   - File content is enclosed within:
     ```plaintext
     ```
     This ensures you treat the content as raw text for analysis.

4. **Error Notes**:
   - If a file couldn’t be read, the section includes a note:
     ```markdown
     **Could not read file relative/path/to/file**
     ```

---

## YOUR TASK: INGESTION AND ANALYSIS

1. **Sequential Processing**:
   - Begin with `consolidated_repository_part_1.md` and continue in numerical order.
   - Reconstruct the repository's structure from the sequential sections.

2. **Parsing Markdown**:
   - Identify sections using `## relative/path/to/file` headers.
   - Extract file content from code blocks (` ```plaintext `).

3. **Understanding Metadata**:
   - Use the section headers to determine file paths and contextualize content.

4. **Content Analysis**:
   - Treat content as raw text or apply appropriate parsing if the file type is identifiable (e.g., Python, JSON, YAML).
   - Handle error notes by skipping those sections and logging the details.

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

After ingestion, you should be able to:
1. Reconstruct the repository’s structure and contents.
2. Generate detailed summaries for each file or section.
3. Identify potential issues, such as:
   - Code inefficiencies or errors.
   - Inconsistent or missing documentation.
   - Areas for improvement in configuration or structure.

4. Provide actionable insights, such as:
   - Suggestions for improving the repository.
   - Recommendations for refactoring or optimization.
   - High-level overviews of key functionalities.

## EXAMPLE INGESTION PROMPT

To process the files, follow these instructions:

```
You are an advanced large language model tasked with analyzing a Git repository split into multiple Markdown files. Each file contains:
1. A main title: `# Consolidated Repository`.
2. Sections, where each is introduced by a relative path header: `## relative/path/to/file`.
3. Content of each file enclosed in code blocks (` ```plaintext `).

Your task:
- Process each split file sequentially (`consolidated_repository_part_1.md`, `consolidated_repository_part_2.md`, etc.).
- Reconstruct the original repository structure based on the section headers.
- Analyze the content of each code block, providing insights, summaries, and potential improvements.
- Log and skip any sections marked with "Could not read file."

Output:
- A complete reconstruction of the repository structure.
- Summaries and actionable insights for each file.
- Identification of issues and areas for optimization.
```

## ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR YOUR CONTEXT

- **Token Efficiency**: Each split file is capped at 500 lines, ensuring compatibility with LLM token limits.
- **Error Resilience**: Skipping unreadable files ensures your analysis isn’t interrupted.
- **Iterative Processing**: The sequential structure guarantees continuity between files.

---

## BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH

1. **Overcomes Size Constraints**:
   - Allows you to process large repositories incrementally, avoiding token overflow.

2. **Structured Navigation**:
   - Headers and code blocks simplify your ability to parse and contextualize content.

3. **Focused Analysis**:
   - By breaking the repository into smaller parts, you can focus on details without losing sight of the overall structure.
